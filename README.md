## Data-Structure-Assignment-1-Arrays
### Project Requirements
1. Both classes should have an array int arr[] as a member variable.
2. Both classes should have a constructor that accept an integer that is used as the size to initialize
the arr[].
3. Both classes should have the insert(int x) method for inserting an integer into the arr[].
4. Both classes should have the delete(int x) method for removing an integer in the arr[] if it exists and return true. If the integer does not exist, the method should return false.
5. Both classes should have the find(intx) method for searching for an integer in the arr[] if it exists and return it index. If the integer does not exist, the method should return âˆ’1.
6. Both classes should have the get(int index) method for returning an integer in the arr[] at the given index. It should handle if the index is out of bounds and throw the IndexOutOfBoundsException.
7. Both classes should have the size() method that return the current size of arr[] as an integer.
8. Both classes should have the resize(intnewSize) method for changing the size of the arr[] to the
given newSize. Discard any items in the arr[] that are outside of the new arr[] size.
9. The arr[] in the UnorderedArray is unsorted and the arr[] in the OrderedArray must be sorted.
